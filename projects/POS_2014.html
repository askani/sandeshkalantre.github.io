            <p><h2>Pulsar Observatory for&nbsp;Students(2014)</h2>
<p>This was my introduction to radio astronomy.It was organised
by National Centre for Radio Astrophysics(<span class="caps">NCRA</span>) under Tata Institute of Funcdamental Research(<span class="caps">TIFR</span>).More information about <span class="caps">POS</span> can be found <a href="http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/rpl/pos">here</a> </p>
<p>The project was held at the Ooty Radio Telescope at Ooty, Tamil Nadu.It was conducted in two phases where the first part in July consisted of a theorotical introduction to pulsars and radio astronomy in&nbsp;general.</p>
<p><img src="http://home.iitb.ac.in/~sandeshkalantre/images/ort.jpg" alt="ORT" style="width: 640px"/> </p>
<p>The second stage involved field work in which we had to actually collect
data for the pulsars and use it to analyse the features of the pulsar.
In all there we five experiments which we were supposed to&nbsp;perform:</p>
<ol>
<li>Estimation of Dispersion&nbsp;Measure</li>
<li>Estimation of flux density of&nbsp;pulsar</li>
<li>Estimation of modulation index of&nbsp;pulsar</li>
<li>Estimation of the Period of&nbsp;pulsar</li>
<li>Estimation of the Pulse broadening of pulsars due to interstellar&nbsp;scattering</li>
</ol>
<p>I decided to choose the following pulsars for the experiments:<strong>B0329+54
</strong> and the famous <strong>Vela pulsar B0833-45</strong>.The observations were taken 
on the nights of 31st December 2014 and 2nd January 2015. The observation 
period was generally of the order of 10 minutes since both pulars were relatively bright sources.(B0329+54 flux ~ 1500mJy and Vela&nbsp;~5000mJy)</p>
<h3>B0329+54</h3>
<p>This pulsar has a period of about ~700 milli seconds.Using a Fourier transform on the time series observed,the period was accurately determined as <strong>714.572 ± 0.000021 milli seconds</strong>. After this the profile was folded with the
determined time period over the observation length to improve the signal
to noise ratio.The final profile obtained was as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<p><img src="http://home.iitb.ac.in/~sandeshkalantre/images/B0329+54_profile.jpg" alt = "B0329+54 Profile" style="width: 640px"/></p>
<h3>B0833-45 The Vela&nbsp;Pulsar</h3>
<p>This is one of the brightest pulsars in the sky.The same analysis was repeated on data for this pulsar.Finally I obtained the time period as <strong>89.37971 ± 0.00042 milli seconds</strong>.The final profile looked&nbsp;like:</p>
<p><img alt="B0833-45 profile" src="http://home.iitb.ac.in/~sandeshkalantre/images/B0833-45_profile.jpg" /></p>
<p>One can unmistakbly see that the profile shape is not at all symmetrical
and an exponential decay tail is observed.This was the basis of the last experiment which involed measurement of pulse broadning due to interstellar&nbsp;scattering.</p>
<p>Broadly(no pun intended), the broad shape of the profile can be explanined
as arising due to random fluctuations in the refractive index of the interstellar medium. Note that this is quite distinct from the pulse dispersion which results because of the <span class="caps">ISM</span> being a non-dispersive radio medium.If one were to put up an analogy in the optical domain,one can say that this is in some sense twinkling of the pulsar in the radio frequency range.But this idea should not be taken too seriouly for it has its&nbsp;pitfalls.</p>
<p>One can fit the tail as an exponential decay to estimate something known
as the scattering timescale.This gives us a measure of time-scale of random fluctutaions in the <span class="caps">ISM</span>. For the Vela pulsar, I obtained it to be ~<strong>11.13 ± 0.78ms</strong>.</p>
<p>On the last day,we were supposed to give a presentation of the analysis we
had done.The slides of this presentation can be found <a href="http://home.iitb.ac.in/~sandeshkalantre/presentations/sandesh_pos2014.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>At the end, I would like to say that this was quite an interesting experience and quite an enjoyable one at that&nbsp;too!</p></p>
