            <p><p>This page contains accounts of my encounters with the world of physics.</p>

<h3>Autumn 2015 - Quantum Entanglement and Teleportation</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>I was introducted to the nitty-gritty details of working with real qubits. Though it may seem very easy to work with single qubit rotations and two-qubit logic gates, experimentally it is very difficult to model these operation using real world Hamiltonians.</p>
<p>I studied the porperties of the exchange Hamiltonian which can be used to model interaction of electrons with nuclear spin baths. I simulated the evolution of the spin values and the von-Neumann entropy using the QuTiP package in Python.</p>

<h3>Autumn 2015 - Metapopulation Dynamics and Coupled Logistic Maps</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>This work was part of the Non-Linear Dynamics course. Finally I came to terms with 'cool' notions such as <em>chaos</em>, <em>fractrals</em> and <em>fractional dimensions</em>. The idea for this project emerged from a recurring theme we saw as a group of friends while playing the popular game <em>Age of Empires</em>. It seemed that small mistakes made by a player can have large repurcussions in the overall score of the player. We though this was a signature of non-linearity in the system and decided to study it.</p>
<p><img alt='Non-linearity in AOE' src='images/aoe.jpg' style="width:640px" /></p>
<p>We stumbled upon a field called Metapopulation Dynamics. We studied coupled logistic maps as model of the system. My work involved calculation of the Lyapunov exponents of the system given the time-series. I also studied the celebrated Taken's embedding theorem and attemped attractor reconstruction on simple model systems. Overall, it was a nice excursion in the exciting world of Non-Linear Dynamics. </p>

<h3>June 2015 - Quantum Algorithms and Information</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>This project was awarded under the National Initiative for Undergraduate Science (NIUS) Programme in Physics. I worked under
Prof. P. K. Panigrahi, IISER Kolkata.</p>
<p>I mainly looked deep into the field of Quantum Computation which was introduced to me Prof. Panigrahi himself in winter selection 
camp for the NIUS programme. I was introduced to the standard battery of quantum algorithms - <em>Deutsch-Josza</em>, the all powerful <em>Shor's algorithm</em> 
and my personal favorite <em>Grover's algorithm</em>. </p>
<p>I tried to come up with an idea for solving the Eulerian path problem optimally as compared to classical
algorithms. I also looked at quantum cryptography protocols and investigated the newly published Noh's protocol for counterfactual transfer of quantum 
information. </p>
<p>The project itself was an introduction to real world academic research for me. Needless to say, I intend to delve more deeply so. </p>

<h3>December 2014 - <a href="pos.html">Pulsar Observatory for Students (POS)</a></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>I was selected for a week long programme on radio astronomy in general and pulsar astronomy in particular.
The camp itself was held at the Radio Astronomy Centre, Ooty which being famous for its temperate climate 
also incidently houses the <em>Ooty Radio Telescope</em>, a cylindrical paraboidal telescope mainly working at
326 MHz frequencies.</p>
<p>My work included in collecting data for real pulsars using the ORT and analysing it to determine the 
pulsar parameters such as Dispersion Measure, Modulation Index and Scattering due to ISM.</p>
<p>Overall it was a nice experience as who gets to collect data in real time from a real telescope. :P
